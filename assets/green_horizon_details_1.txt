Established: 2012

Overview
Green Horizons Initiative (GHI) is an international nonprofit organization committed to addressing environmental challenges and fostering sustainable development. With its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, GHI operates globally, working closely with local communities, governments, and environmental experts to create a greener, more sustainable future.

Mission
To combat environmental degradation, promote climate resilience, and empower communities with sustainable solutions that improve their quality of life while protecting natural resources for future generations.

Key Achievements

Earth Bloom Campaign (2014)
GHI launched a massive reforestation project across deforested regions in South Asia, resulting in the plantation of over 1 million native trees. This effort restored biodiversity, reduced soil erosion, and improved air quality, positively impacting thousands of lives.

Clean Rivers Initiative (2017-2019)
Focused on combating water pollution, this project cleaned three major rivers in Southeast Asia by installing waste collection systems and organizing awareness drives among local communities. This initiative reduced waterborne diseases and improved the livelihood of fishermen and farmers dependent on these rivers.

Solar Villages Program (2020-Present)
In partnership with local governments and private donors, GHI has successfully provided solar energy to over 50 remote villages in Sub-Saharan Africa. By installing solar grids and training local technicians, the project has not only replaced expensive and polluting energy sources but also created new employment opportunities.

Climate Education Drive
GHI organizes workshops, campaigns, and community outreach programs to educate people on climate change, waste management, and renewable energy. These initiatives have reached over 500,000 students and individuals worldwide.
